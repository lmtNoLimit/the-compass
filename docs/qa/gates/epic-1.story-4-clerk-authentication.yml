recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Do not deploy to production until webhook tests are fixed"
    - "Set up staging environment for webhook testing"
    - "Add database transaction support before any production use"
  
  short_term:
    - "Expand test coverage to 90%+ before next sprint"
    - "Implement proper logging infrastructure"
    - "Add performance monitoring for auth operations"
  
  long_term:
    - "Consider implementing webhook event replay capability"
    - "Add comprehensive E2E test suite with Playwright"
    - "Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies"

decision_rationale: |
  The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with proper use of Clerk SDK,
  good error handling via boundaries, and clean architecture following React Router v7 patterns.
  However, the 25% test failure rate specifically around webhook functionality presents a 
  significant risk to data synchronization reliability. The failing tests indicate potential
  production issues with user data consistency between Clerk and PostgreSQL.
  
  While core authentication features work, the data synchronization concerns must be addressed
  before production deployment to ensure reliability and prevent user data inconsistencies.
  
  The CONCERNS rating reflects that while the implementation is fundamentally sound, the
  webhook issues represent a critical gap that could impact production reliability.

conditions_for_pass:
  - "All webhook tests passing (100% for webhook suite)"
  - "Overall test pass rate â‰¥ 90%"
  - "Webhook functionality verified in staging environment"
  - "Database transactions implemented for webhook operations"
  - "Structured logging implemented for production debugging"
