summary: |
  Story 1.1 successfully refactored after Story 1.3.5 migration to proper React Router v7 structure.
  All 6 acceptance criteria are implemented, but code quality issues prevent PASS status.
  40 ESLint/Prettier violations and limited test coverage (17%) require immediate attention.

recommendations:

    - "Add state management tests"
    - "Verify tests pass after formatting fixes"

    - "Update ESLint configuration to remove deprecation warning"
    - "Replace TypeScript 'any' with proper types"
    - "Document test coverage requirements"
    
  nice_to_have:
    - "Add integration tests for Clerk authentication"
    - "Add E2E tests for critical user journeys"
    - "Implement test coverage reporting"

decision_rationale: |
  The refactoring successfully addressed all structural issues from the monorepo migration.
  React Router v7 implementation is excellent with proper flat structure at root level.
  However, code quality standards must be enforced before DONE status.
  The 40 formatting violations and minimal test coverage present medium risk to
  maintainability and future development velocity. These issues are readily fixable
  but must be addressed to maintain project quality standards.

next_steps:
  1. Developer to run formatting fixes
  2. Developer to add critical test coverage
  3. Re-run QA gate after fixes complete
  4. Transition to DONE upon successful resolution
