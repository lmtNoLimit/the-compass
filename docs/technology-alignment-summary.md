# Technology Stack Alignment Summary

## Date: 2025-09-04

This document summarizes the technology alignment decisions made to resolve conflicts between the PRD and Architecture documents.

## Aligned Technology Decisions

### Core Infrastructure

| Component | Original PRD | Original Architecture | **ALIGNED DECISION** | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Database** | MongoDB | PostgreSQL (Neon) | **PostgreSQL (Neon)** | Better for structured data, type safety with Prisma, serverless scaling |
| **Deployment** | Render | Vercel | **Vercel** | Native React Router v7 support, integrated services (KV, Blob), edge network optimization |
| **Authentication** | Basic Auth | Clerk | **Clerk** | Enterprise-grade security, reduced implementation complexity |
| **CSS Framework** | Tailwind 3.4+ | Tailwind 3.4+ | **Tailwind 4.0+** | Latest version with Lightning CSS performance benefits |

### Supporting Technologies (Aligned)

| Component | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Frontend Framework | Remix | 2.5+ | SSR React framework |
| Frontend Language | TypeScript | 5.3+ | Type safety throughout |
| UI Components | Radix UI | 1.1+ | Accessible headless components |
| ORM | Prisma | Latest | Type-safe database access |
| Backend Framework | Express.js | 4.18+ | REST API server |
| Testing | Vitest | 1.0+ | Consistent across stack |
| Build Tool | Vite | 5.0+ | Fast builds with ESM |
| AI Integration | Google Vertex AI | Latest | Via ADK framework |

## Documents Updated

### PRD Updates
✅ Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure
- Changed MongoDB references to PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Updated authentication from basic auth to Clerk
- Confirmed Render as deployment platform

✅ Epic 3: Feature Brief Input & Validation Flow
- Updated data model references from MongoDB to Prisma/PostgreSQL

✅ Epic 4: Validation Brief Generation & Presentation
- Changed storage references from MongoDB to PostgreSQL

### Architecture Updates
✅ tech-stack.md
- Updated Tailwind CSS to version 4.0+
- Confirmed Vercel as deployment platform (aligned with React Router v7)
- Maintained Vercel KV/Blob for cache/storage
- Maintained Vercel Analytics for monitoring

✅ deployment-architecture.md
- Changed from Vercel serverless to Render web service
- Updated deployment commands and configuration

### Story Updates
✅ Story 1.1: Initialize Remix Project with TypeScript
- Added PostgreSQL/Prisma setup tasks
- Added Clerk authentication foundation
- Added Radix UI configuration
- Updated to Tailwind CSS v4
- Added Render deployment preparation
- Expanded Dev Notes with aligned technologies

## Implementation Impact

### Positive Impacts
1. **Unified Database**: PostgreSQL provides better type safety and relational data modeling
2. **Simplified Auth**: Clerk removes need to build authentication from scratch
3. **Single Platform**: Vercel hosts both frontend and backend with edge optimization
4. **Modern CSS**: Tailwind v4 offers performance improvements

### Migration Considerations
1. **Database Schema**: Need to design PostgreSQL schema with Prisma
2. **Auth Integration**: Clerk setup requires dashboard configuration
3. **Deployment Config**: render.yaml configuration needed
4. **Environment Variables**: Different set of env vars for new stack

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Developer can proceed with Story 1.1 implementation
   - Set up Neon database instance
   - Create Clerk account and configure authentication
   - Prepare Vercel project and environment

2. **Documentation Maintenance**:
   - Continue updating remaining architecture documents as needed
   - Update any remaining MongoDB references in other epics
   - Ensure all stories reflect aligned technology stack

3. **Technical Decisions Pending**:
   - Vercel KV configuration for session management
   - Vercel Blob storage for file exports
   - Vercel Analytics and Web Vitals configuration

## Approval

This alignment has been reviewed and approved for implementation. All future development should follow these technology decisions unless formally revised through a documented change process.
