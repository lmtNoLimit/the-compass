## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3.5 successfully migrated the project to proper React Router v7 structure at the root level
- The application now follows the correct file-based routing pattern with routes in app/routes/
- Vercel deployment is configured and working with React Router v7

### Authentication Architecture
**Technology Stack:**
- Authentication Provider: Clerk React Router SDK v5.0+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Authentication]
- Session Management: Handled by Clerk with JWT tokens [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#User-Authentication-Flow]
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma for User record storage [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database]

### File Structure and Locations
Based on the unified project structure, new files should be created at:
- Authentication routes: `app/routes/sign-in.tsx`, `app/routes/sign-up.tsx` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#/app/routes]
- Webhook handler: `app/routes/api.clerk-webhook.tsx` (follows API route pattern) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#API-routes]
- Protected route component: `app/components/features/ProtectedRoute.tsx` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#/app/components]
- User state store updates: `app/stores/userStore.ts` (already exists) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#/app/stores]
- Type definitions: Update `app/types/index.ts` with auth types [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#/app/types]

### Clerk Integration Details
**External API Configuration:**
- Base URL: https://api.clerk.com/v1 [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Clerk-Authentication-API]
- Rate Limits: 10,000 requests per minute for production [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Clerk-Authentication-API]
- Key endpoints:
  - GET /users/{userId} - Fetch user profile data
  - POST /sessions/{sessionId}/verify - Verify JWT tokens [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Clerk-Authentication-API]

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Client-side public key (prefix with VITE_ for client access) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#API-Client-Setup]
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Server-side secret key for webhook validation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Auth-Flow]

### Data Models
**User Model (Prisma Schema):**
```prisma
model User {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  clerkId      String   @unique
  email        String   @unique
  name         String
  organization String?
  role         Role     @default(USER)
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  lastLoginAt  DateTime?
  
  featureBriefs FeatureBrief[]
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Schema-Design]

### Frontend Authentication Pattern
**Protected Route Implementation:**
```typescript
import { Navigate, Outlet } from "react-router";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/react-router";

export function ProtectedRoute() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth();
  
  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  
  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return <Navigate to="/sign-in" replace />;
  }
  
  return <Outlet />;
}
```
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Protected-Route-Pattern]

### Backend Authentication Middleware
The backend should verify Clerk JWT tokens for API routes:
```typescript
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

export async function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });
  }
  
  const session = await clerkClient.sessions.verifySession('', token);
  
  if (!session) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
  
  req.auth = { userId: session.userId };
  next();
}
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Middleware/Guards]

### API Client Configuration
The frontend API client needs to include Clerk auth token:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/react-router';
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api/v1',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
});
```
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#API-Client-Setup]

### Naming Conventions
- React components: PascalCase (e.g., `ProtectedRoute.tsx`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming-Conventions]
- API routes: kebab-case with api prefix (e.g., `api.clerk-webhook.tsx`) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#File-Naming-Conventions]
- Hook files: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming-Conventions]
- Environment variables: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming-Conventions]

### Testing Requirements

**Test File Locations:**
- Component tests: `tests/unit/components/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test-Organization]
- Route tests: `tests/unit/routes/api.clerk-webhook.test.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test-Organization]

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Testing Library: Vitest 1.0+ with Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend-Testing]
- Mocking: Mock Clerk SDK in tests using vitest mocks [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Component-Test]

**Test Pattern for Components with Clerk:**
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react-router';
```
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Component-Test]

### Security Considerations
- Never log or expose sensitive data (tokens, keys) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical-Fullstack-Rules]
- Always validate input in webhook handlers [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical-Fullstack-Rules]
- Use environment variables through config objects, never process.env directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical-Fullstack-Rules]
- Implement proper error handling for all async operations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical-Fullstack-Rules]

### Project Structure Alignment Notes
- The project follows React Router v7's unified full-stack pattern with no separate backend directory
- API routes are colocated with frontend routes using the `api.*.tsx` naming pattern
- Server-only code uses the `.server.ts` suffix for clarity
- All authentication-related components should follow the existing component organization pattern

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test file location:** Tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory with subdirectories matching the source structure
- **Test file naming:** Use `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` suffix for test files
- **Testing framework:** Use Vitest 1.0+ for all unit and integration tests
- **Component testing:** Use Testing Library for React component tests
- **Mocking:** Use vitest mocks for external dependencies like Clerk SDK
- **Test organization:** Group related tests using describe blocks
- **Coverage requirements:** Aim for minimum 80% code coverage for authentication components
- **E2E testing:** Future implementation with Playwright for full authentication flow testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-05
### Reviewer: Quinn (QA Agent)
### Decision: CONCERNS ⚠️

#### Executive Summary
Story implementation demonstrates solid authentication architecture with Clerk integration, but webhook test failures (75% pass rate) present significant data synchronization risks that must be addressed before production deployment.

#### Requirements Coverage
✅ **Met (5/7)**: Clerk integration, protected routes, session management, logout, basic error handling
⚠️ **Partial (1/7)**: OAuth providers (configuration unverified)
🔴 **At Risk (1/7)**: User profile synchronization (webhook tests failing)

#### Test Analysis
- **Coverage**: 18/24 tests passing (75%)
- **Critical Issue**: All 6 failing tests are webhook-related
- **Root Cause**: Svix mocking issues causing TypeError in event processing
- **Impact**: Data sync reliability between Clerk and PostgreSQL unverified

#### Risk Assessment
🔴 **HIGH**: Data synchronization reliability - could cause user data inconsistencies
⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Test coverage gaps, error monitoring limitations
🟡 **LOW**: UX edge cases

#### Critical Findings
1. **Webhook Handler Issues**:
   - No transaction handling for database operations
   - Missing retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Test failures indicate potential production issues

2. **Security Posture**: ✅ GOOD
   - Proper JWT handling via Clerk
   - Webhook signature verification implemented
   - Routes properly protected

3. **Code Quality**: ✅ GOOD
   - Clean architecture following React Router v7 patterns
   - Proper TypeScript typing
   - Good error boundaries

#### Required Actions for PASS
1. Fix all webhook test failures (svix mocking)
2. Verify webhook functionality in staging
3. Add database transaction handling
4. Achieve 90%+ test pass rate

#### Recommendations
**High Priority**:
- Enhance test coverage with integration tests
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Medium Priority**:
- Improve error recovery strategies
- Add offline handling
- Implement monitoring and alerting
