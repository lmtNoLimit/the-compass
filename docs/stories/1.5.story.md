## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 implementation:
- ✅ ClerkProvider already configured in root.tsx
- ✅ Basic header with navigation already exists in app/root.tsx
- ✅ UserButton component from Clerk is already integrated
- ✅ Protected routes are configured with authentication
- ✅ SignedIn/SignedOut components available for conditional rendering
- ⚠️ Current navigation uses basic anchor tags, needs upgrade to NavLink

### Component Architecture
**File Structure and Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Directory Purposes]:
```
app/components/
├── layouts/               # Layout components (currently empty, needs AppShell.tsx)
│   └── AppShell.tsx      # Main application shell to be created
├── ui/                   # Reusable UI components (Button.tsx, Dialog.tsx exist)
└── features/             # Feature components (ProtectedRoute.tsx, AuthErrorBoundary.tsx exist)
```

**Component Template Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]:
```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router";
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button";
import type { ComponentProps } from "~/types";

interface ComponentProps {
  // Component interface
}

export function ComponentName({ props }: ComponentProps) {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  
  return (
    <div className="tailwind-classes">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Navigation Implementation
**Current Root Layout** (app/root.tsx):
- Header already exists with basic navigation
- Uses Clerk's UserButton for user menu
- Has SignedIn/SignedOut conditional rendering
- Navigation links currently use anchor tags (need to upgrade to NavLink)

**React Router Navigation Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Route Configuration]:
- Use React Router's NavLink component for navigation with active states
- Use useNavigate hook for programmatic navigation
- Routes are defined in app/routes.ts using file-based routing

### Authentication Integration
**Clerk Integration for User Display** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Protected Route Pattern]:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/react-router";
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/react-router";

// For user email display
const { user, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth();
// Access user email via: user?.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress
```

### Styling Approach
**Tailwind CSS Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]:
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ configured in tailwind.config.ts
- Use with Radix UI for accessible components
- Existing UI components use Tailwind utility classes

**Responsive Design Breakpoints**:
- Tablet: `sm:` prefix (640px and up)
- Desktop: `lg:` prefix (1024px and up)
- Use flex and grid utilities for responsive layouts

### State Management
**Global State Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Structure]:
- Zustand store exists at app/stores/userStore.ts
- Can extend for navigation state (sidebar open/closed, etc.)
```typescript
interface AppState {
  sidebarOpen: boolean;
  toggleSidebar: () => void;
}
```

### Loading States
**React Query for Loading States** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Management Patterns]:
- React Query already configured in root.tsx
- Use for background data fetching with loading states
- Built-in loading, error, and success states

**Navigation Loading Pattern**:
```typescript
import { useNavigation } from "react-router";

const navigation = useNavigation();
const isNavigating = navigation.state === "loading";
```

### Import Patterns and Naming Conventions
**Import Aliases** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Import Aliases]:
- `~/components` → `app/components`
- `~/lib` → `app/lib`
- `~/types` → `app/types`

**Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]:
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `AppShell.tsx`)
- Functions: camelCase
- TypeScript Types: PascalCase
- Tailwind classes: kebab-case

### Technical Constraints
- React Router v7.0+ (file-based routing)
- React 18+ with TypeScript 5.3+
- Clerk React Router SDK v5.0+ for authentication
- Radix UI 1.1+ for accessible UI components
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for styling

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]:
- Component tests: `tests/unit/components/AppShell.test.tsx`
- Follows existing test directory structure (no additional subdirectories)

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend Component Test]:
- Vitest 1.0+ with Testing Library
- Mock Clerk SDK using vitest mocks
- QueryClient wrapper for React Query testing

**Component Test Pattern** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend Component Test]:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react-router';

const wrapper = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <ClerkProvider publishableKey="test">
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {children}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </ClerkProvider>
);
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Test responsive behavior at tablet (640px) and desktop (1024px) breakpoints
- Test navigation state changes and active link styling
- Test user email display when authenticated
- Test loading states during navigation
- Mock window.matchMedia for responsive testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with a well-structured React component architecture. The AppShell component follows established patterns, utilizes TypeScript properly, and integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system. The responsive design is thoughtfully implemented with proper breakpoints and mobile-first considerations.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: app/components/layouts/AppShell.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed accessibility issues in mobile menu Dialog
  - **Why**: Radix UI Dialog components require proper ARIA labels for screen reader accessibility
  - **How**: Added Dialog.Title and Dialog.Description components with appropriate screen reader only styling

- **File**: app/components/layouts/AppShell.tsx
  - **Change**: Replaced useAuth with useUser hook from Clerk
  - **Why**: useAuth doesn't provide user object directly in @clerk/react-router v1.9.8
  - **How**: Changed to useUser hook which correctly provides user data including email addresses

- **File**: app/components/layouts/AppShell.tsx
  - **Change**: Removed unused ClerkProvider import and navigationStore import
  - **Why**: Imports were not being used in the component
  - **How**: Cleaned up imports to only include used dependencies

- **File**: app/stores/navigationStore.ts
  - **Change**: Deleted unused file
  - **Why**: The store was created but never utilized in the implementation
  - **How**: Removed the file as state management wasn't needed for current navigation implementation

- **File**: tests/unit/components/AppShell.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed test mocking strategy for better isolation
  - **Why**: Tests were affecting each other due to shared mock state
  - **How**: Implemented configurable mock state that resets between tests

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript, React, and Tailwind conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Component properly placed in layouts directory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 17 test cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed Dialog accessibility warnings for mobile menu
- [x] Corrected Clerk hook usage for user data access
- [x] Fixed failing tests and improved test isolation
- [x] Cleaned up unused imports and files
- [x] Applied consistent code formatting with Prettier
- [ ] Consider adding E2E tests for critical navigation flows
- [ ] Consider implementing route-based code splitting for better performance
- [ ] Consider adding analytics tracking for navigation events

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Authentication is properly handled through Clerk with protected routes configured. User data is accessed securely through authenticated hooks.

### Performance Considerations

The implementation includes loading states for navigation transitions and uses React Router's built-in optimizations. The responsive design properly handles different viewport sizes. Future enhancement could include route-based code splitting to improve initial load times.

### Files Modified During Review

- app/components/layouts/AppShell.tsx (accessibility fixes, hook changes, import cleanup)
- tests/unit/components/AppShell.test.tsx (test fixes and improvements)
- app/stores/navigationStore.ts (deleted - unused)
