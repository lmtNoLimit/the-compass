## Dev Notes

### Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The Remix application should be created in the `apps/web/` directory with the following structure:
```
apps/web/
├── app/
│   ├── components/     # UI components
│   ├── routes/         # Page routes
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
│   ├── lib/            # Frontend utilities
│   ├── styles/         # Global styles
│   ├── entry.client.tsx
│   ├── entry.server.tsx
│   └── root.tsx
├── public/             # Static assets
├── tests/              # Frontend tests
├── .env.example
├── package.json
├── remix.config.js
└── tailwind.config.js

packages/shared/         # Shared types package
├── src/
│   ├── types/          # TypeScript interfaces
│   └── utils/          # Shared utilities
└── package.json
```

### Technology Stack Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - ALIGNED WITH PROJECT DECISION]
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.3+ for type-safe frontend development
- **Remix**: Version 2.5+ for SSR React framework
- **UI Libraries**: 
  - **Radix UI**: Version 1.1+ for accessible headless components
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Version 4.0+ for utility-first CSS (per user requirement)
- **Database**: 
  - **PostgreSQL (Neon)**: Version 16+ for primary data store
  - **Prisma**: ORM for database access
- **Authentication**: 
  - **Clerk**: Version 4.0+ for user authentication
- **Deployment**:
  - **Render**: For application hosting (per project decision)
- **Build Tools**:
  - **Vite**: Version 5.0+ as build tool
  - **esbuild**: Via Vite for JS/TS compilation
- **Testing**:
  - **Vitest**: Version 1.0+ for unit/integration tests
  - **Testing Library**: For component testing

### Coding Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Components use PascalCase naming (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Hooks use camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Functions use camelCase (e.g., `validateBrief()`)
- Environment variables use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`)
- TypeScript types use PascalCase (e.g., `FeatureBrief`)

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
Test organization for frontend:
```
apps/web/tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── components/
│   └── hooks/
├── integration/
│   └── routes/
└── e2e/
```

Use Vitest with Testing Library for component tests. Example test pattern:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ComponentName } from '~/components/path';

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<ComponentName />);
    expect(screen.getByText('expected')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Critical Rules [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never access process.env directly - use config objects
- All async functions must have proper error handling
- Never log or expose sensitive data
- Always validate input
- Database access through Prisma only, never raw SQL except for specific search queries
- Always define types in packages/shared and import from there

### Database Configuration Notes
- **Prisma Schema Location**: apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma (per unified structure)
- **Connection**: Use DATABASE_URL environment variable for Neon PostgreSQL
- **Client Generation**: Run `npx prisma generate` after schema creation
- **Initial Schema**: Create basic User model matching authentication requirements

### Authentication Configuration Notes  
- **Clerk Integration**: Install @clerk/remix for Remix-specific integration
- **Environment Variables Required**:
  - CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (from Clerk dashboard)
  - CLERK_SECRET_KEY (from Clerk dashboard)
- **Provider Setup**: Wrap app with ClerkProvider in root.tsx
- **Protected Routes**: Will be implemented in future stories

### Deployment Configuration Notes
- **Render Setup**: render.yaml should include:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Start command: `npm run start`
  - Environment: Node 20+
  - Auto-deploy from main branch
- **Environment Variables**: Configure in Render dashboard after initial deployment

### Testing
- Test files should be located in `apps/web/tests/unit/` for unit tests
- Use Vitest 1.0+ as testing framework
- Use Testing Library for React component testing
- Follow the test organization structure from architecture/testing-strategy.md
- Ensure basic test runs successfully before marking story complete
