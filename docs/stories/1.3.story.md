# Story 1.3: Configure Vercel Deployment Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** automated deployment to Vercel,  
**so that** code changes are automatically deployed using React Router's official deployment patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard (DATABASE_URL, CLERK_*, etc.)
3. Automatic deployments from main branch enabled
4. Preview deployments for pull requests configured
5. Custom domain configured (if available)
6. Build settings optimized for React Router v7
7. Deployment successful with application accessible via Vercel URL
8. Vercel Analytics and Web Vitals enabled for monitoring

### Vercel Deployment Configuration
**Platform:** Vercel with SSR/Edge Functions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Framework: React Router v7.0+
- Build Tool: Vite 5.0+
- Deployment Type: SSR with serverless functions
- Framework Preset: React Router (auto-detected by Vercel)
- Node Version: 20.x (specify in package.json engines field)

### React Router v7 with Vercel Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Frontend Framework]
- Package: `@vercel/react-router` (dev dependency)
- Config Location: `react-router.config.ts` in project root
- SSR Mode: Enabled by default in React Router v7
- API Routes: Serverless functions via `app/routes/api.*.ts` pattern
- Edge Runtime: Available for optimized performance

### Environment Variables Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```bash
# Database (Neon PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname?sslmode=require

# Clerk Authentication (React Router SDK)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...  # Client-side (VITE_ prefix required)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...            # Server-side only

# Auto-set by Vercel
NODE_ENV=production                     # Automatic in production
VERCEL_URL=*.vercel.app                # Deployment URL
```

### Health Check Implementation Details
**File:** `app/routes/api.health.ts`
```typescript
// Example structure (for reference)
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from "react-router";
import { json } from "react-router";
import { prisma } from "~/lib/prisma.server";

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  // Implementation will check:
  // 1. Basic service health
  // 2. Database connection (if DATABASE_URL exists)
  // 3. Return JSON with status and checks
}
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test Framework: Vitest 1.0+
- Test Location: `tests/unit/routes/api.health.test.ts`
- Test Pattern: Follow existing patterns in tests/unit/
- Mock Requirements: Mock Prisma client for database checks
- Assertions: Status code 200, JSON structure, database status field

### Vercel-Specific Features to Configure
- **Analytics:** Enable in project settings for Web Vitals
- **Speed Insights:** Enable for performance monitoring
- **Preview Deployments:** Automatic for each PR
- **Environment Variables:** Separate for Production/Preview/Development
- **Custom Domain:** Add in project settings > Domains
- **Deployment Notifications:** Configure in project settings > Integrations

### Build and Deployment Commands
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev           # Start development server

# Local build test
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Testing
npm run test         # Run Vitest tests
```

### Prisma Database Connection
[Source: Story 1.2 completion]
- Prisma client already configured in project
- Connection pooling handled by Neon
- Import from `~/lib/prisma.server` for server-side usage

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: tests/unit/routes/api.health.test.ts
- Testing framework: Vitest 1.0+
- Test Example:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { loader } from '~/routes/api.health';

describe('Health Check Endpoint', () => {
  it('returns 200 status with health info', async () => {
    const response = await loader({ request: new Request('http://localhost/api/health') });
    const data = await response.json();
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(data).toHaveProperty('status', 'healthy');
    expect(data).toHaveProperty('timestamp');
    expect(data).toHaveProperty('database');
  });
});
```

### File List
- Modified: package.json (added engines field for Node.js version)
- Modified: app/routes.ts (added health check route configuration)
- Created: app/routes/api.health.tsx (health check endpoint implementation)
- Created: app/lib/prisma.server.ts (Prisma client singleton)
- Created: tests/unit/routes/api.health.test.ts (health check tests)
