- Framework: React Router v7.0+
- Build Tool: Vite 5.0+
- Deployment Type: SSR with serverless functions
- Framework Preset: React Router (auto-detected by Vercel)
- Node Version: 20.x (specify in package.json engines field)

### React Router v7 with Vercel Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Frontend Framework]
- Package: `@vercel/react-router` (dev dependency)
- Config Location: `react-router.config.ts` in project root
- SSR Mode: Enabled by default in React Router v7
- API Routes: Serverless functions via `app/routes/api.*.ts` pattern
- Edge Runtime: Available for optimized performance

### Environment Variables Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```bash
# Database (Neon PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname?sslmode=require

# Clerk Authentication (React Router SDK)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...  # Client-side (VITE_ prefix required)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...            # Server-side only

# Auto-set by Vercel
NODE_ENV=production                     # Automatic in production
VERCEL_URL=*.vercel.app                # Deployment URL
```

### Health Check Implementation Details
**File:** `app/routes/api.health.ts`
```typescript
// Example structure (for reference)
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from "react-router";
import { json } from "react-router";
import { prisma } from "~/lib/prisma.server";

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  // Implementation will check:
  // 1. Basic service health
  // 2. Database connection (if DATABASE_URL exists)
  // 3. Return JSON with status and checks
}
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test Framework: Vitest 1.0+
- Test Location: `tests/unit/routes/api.health.test.ts`
- Test Pattern: Follow existing patterns in tests/unit/
- Mock Requirements: Mock Prisma client for database checks
- Assertions: Status code 200, JSON structure, database status field

### Vercel-Specific Features to Configure
- **Analytics:** Enable in project settings for Web Vitals
- **Speed Insights:** Enable for performance monitoring
- **Preview Deployments:** Automatic for each PR
- **Environment Variables:** Separate for Production/Preview/Development
- **Custom Domain:** Add in project settings > Domains
- **Deployment Notifications:** Configure in project settings > Integrations

### Build and Deployment Commands
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev           # Start development server

# Local build test
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Testing
npm run test         # Run Vitest tests
```

### Prisma Database Connection
[Source: Story 1.2 completion]
- Prisma client already configured in project
- Connection pooling handled by Neon
- Import from `~/lib/prisma.server` for server-side usage

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: tests/unit/routes/api.health.test.ts
- Testing framework: Vitest 1.0+
- Test Example:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { loader } from '~/routes/api.health';

describe('Health Check Endpoint', () => {
  it('returns 200 status with health info', async () => {
    const response = await loader({ request: new Request('http://localhost/api/health') });
    const data = await response.json();
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(data).toHaveProperty('status', 'healthy');
    expect(data).toHaveProperty('timestamp');
    expect(data).toHaveProperty('database');
  });
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Rating: GOOD** - Implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with appropriate error handling, monitoring capabilities, and test coverage. The health check endpoint follows REST best practices and provides comprehensive system status information.

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns with Prisma singleton pattern
- Appropriate use of dynamic imports to handle initialization errors gracefully
- Comprehensive test coverage (6 test cases) covering all scenarios
- Proper HTTP status codes (200/503) based on health state
- Good cache control headers to prevent stale health data

**Areas for Minor Improvement:**
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent health check abuse
- Could benefit from OpenTelemetry instrumentation for better observability
- Response time metrics could be included in health payload

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - code meets quality standards as implemented.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript best practices and naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed per unified structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests with appropriate mocking
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ Production endpoint returns 404 (deployment verification needed)

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

| AC # | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Vercel project created and linked | Manual verification | ✓ |
| 2 | Environment variables configured | Manual verification | ✓ |
| 3 | Automatic deployments enabled | Manual verification | ✓ |
| 4 | Preview deployments configured | Manual verification | ✓ |
| 5 | Custom domain configured | Manual verification | ✓ |
| 6 | Build settings optimized for React Router v7 | Build test passes | ✓ |
| 7 | Deployment successful | ⚠️ Health endpoint 404 | ⚠️ |
| 8 | Analytics and monitoring enabled | Manual verification | ✓ |

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage: ADEQUATE**
- Unit tests appropriately test all code paths
- Mocking strategy is sound (Prisma client mocked correctly)
- Test data management is simple and effective
- Edge cases covered (no DB config, connection failure)

**Test Quality:**
- Tests are readable and well-structured
- Good use of beforeEach for test isolation
- Comprehensive schema validation test
- Response time: ~7ms (excellent)

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**Security: PASS**
- No sensitive data exposed in health endpoint
- Database connection string not leaked in errors
- Proper error message sanitization

**Performance: PASS**  
- Lightweight endpoint with minimal overhead
- Appropriate use of async/await
- No blocking operations

**Reliability: PASS**
- Graceful degradation when database unavailable
- Clear status reporting (healthy/degraded)
- Proper error handling throughout

**Maintainability: PASS**
- Code is self-documenting
- Good separation of concerns
- Type-safe with TypeScript

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Verify production deployment - health endpoint returns 404
- [ ] Consider adding request ID for tracing
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 10 requests/minute)
- [ ] Consider adding response time to health payload
- [ ] Document health check endpoint in API documentation

### Security Review

No critical security issues found. Health endpoint appropriately sanitizes error messages and does not expose sensitive configuration details.

### Performance Considerations

Health check is lightweight and performs well. Test execution completes in ~7ms. Consider caching database connection status for 5-10 seconds to reduce database load under high traffic.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified - code meets quality standards.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-configure-vercel-deployment-pipeline.yml
- Production endpoint verification needed (returns 404)
- All other aspects meet quality standards

### Recommended Status

[⚠️ Verification Required] - Production health endpoint returns 404. Please verify:
1. Deployment actually pushed to Vercel
2. Routes properly configured in production
3. Build artifacts include health endpoint

Once production endpoint is confirmed working, story can move to Done.
