# Story 1.3: Configure Render Deployment Pipeline

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** automated deployment to Render,  
**so that** code changes are automatically deployed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. render.yaml configuration file created with build and start commands
2. Environment variables configured in Render dashboard
3. Automatic deploys from main branch enabled
4. Health check endpoint implemented (/health)
5. Deployment successful with "Hello World" page visible
6. Build logs accessible and deployment notifications configured

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create render.yaml configuration file (AC: 1)
  - [x] Define service type as Web Service (Node.js)
  - [x] Set build command: `npm run build`
  - [x] Set start command: `npm run start`
  - [x] Configure Node.js 20+ runtime environment
  - [x] Set health check path to `/health`
- [x] Implement health check endpoint (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add `/health` route in apps/api/src/routes/
  - [x] Return 200 status with JSON response including database connection status
  - [x] Verify endpoint works with existing Express app setup from Story 1.2
- [x] Configure environment variables in Render (AC: 2)
  - [x] Set DATABASE_URL from Neon connection string
  - [x] Configure NODE_ENV=production
  - [x] Add CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY (for Story 1.4)
  - [ ] Document all required environment variables in deployment documentation
- [ ] Set up automatic deployments from GitHub (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Render service
  - [ ] Configure auto-deploy from main branch
  - [ ] Test auto-deploy trigger with a test commit
- [ ] Deploy and verify application (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Trigger initial deployment to Render
  - [ ] Verify deployment completes successfully
  - [ ] Check that "Hello World" or basic page loads at Render URL
  - [ ] Verify health check endpoint returns 200 status
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Enable Render Metrics for performance monitoring
  - [ ] Set up Render Logs for centralized logging
  - [ ] Configure deployment notifications (email/Slack if available)
  - [ ] Document how to access logs and metrics in Render dashboard
- [x] Add unit tests for health check endpoint (from testing strategy)
  - [x] Create test file in apps/api/tests/unit/routes/health.test.ts
  - [x] Test successful health check response
  - [x] Test database connectivity check in health endpoint

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 implementation:
- Backend API structure created in apps/api/ directory with Express server at apps/api/src/index.ts:25-35
- Database connection utility implemented at apps/api/src/utils/database.ts:1-120
- Neon PostgreSQL configured with proper connection pooling and retry logic
- Health monitoring already partially implemented in database connection utility

### Deployment Configuration
**Platform:** Render [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-strategy]
- Service Type: Web Service (Node.js)
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Start Command: `npm run start`
- Environment: Node.js 20+
- Auto-Deploy: Enabled from main branch

### Project Structure for Deployment Files
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- render.yaml should be placed at project root
- Health check endpoint: apps/api/src/routes/health.routes.ts (following existing route pattern)
- CI/CD workflows location: .github/workflows/ (for future GitHub Actions integration)

### Express Server Configuration
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#controller-route-organization]
- Routes location: apps/api/src/routes/
- Middleware location: apps/api/src/middleware/
- Express app setup: apps/api/src/app.ts
- Follow existing controller/route pattern from backend architecture

### Environment Variables Required
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- DATABASE_URL: Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- NODE_ENV: production/development
- CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: For future authentication (Story 1.4)
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY: For future authentication (Story 1.4)

### Monitoring and Logging Setup
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Monitoring: Render Metrics (built-in application metrics)
- Logging: Render Logs (integrated logging with Render platform)

### Testing
**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test file location: apps/api/tests/unit/routes/health.test.ts
- Testing framework: Vitest 1.0+
- Follow existing backend test patterns from apps/api/tests/unit/
- Test organization follows: unit tests for routes in apps/api/tests/unit/routes/
- Use existing test fixtures and utilities from apps/api/tests/fixtures/
