# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

Establish the core technical foundation including React Router setup, PostgreSQL (Neon) database connection, Vercel deployment pipeline, and Clerk authentication integration. This epic delivers a working application shell with user login capabilities, providing the infrastructure all future features will build upon.

## Story 1.1: Initialize Remix Project with TypeScript

As a developer,
I want a properly configured Remix application with TypeScript,
so that we have a solid foundation for building the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Remix project initialized with TypeScript configuration
2. ESLint and Prettier configured for code consistency
3. Basic folder structure established (routes, components, lib, types)
4. Environment variable management set up with .env.example
5. README updated with setup instructions
6. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore

## Story 1.2: Set Up PostgreSQL Connection and Base Models

As a developer,
I want PostgreSQL (Neon) connected with base data models using Prisma,
so that we can persist application data.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL connection established using DATABASE_URL from env vars
2. Prisma ORM configured with TypeScript for type-safe database access
3. User model created with email, clerk_id, and timestamps in Prisma schema
4. Database connection error handling implemented
5. Connection pooling configured for production use via Neon
6. Local PostgreSQL setup documented for development (or use Neon dev database)

## Story 1.3: Configure Vercel Deployment Pipeline

As a developer,
I want automated deployment to Vercel,
so that code changes are automatically deployed with preview environments.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Vercel project created and linked to GitHub repository
2. Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard (DATABASE_URL, CLERK_*, etc.)
3. Automatic deployments from main branch enabled
4. Preview deployments for pull requests configured
5. Custom domain configured (if available)
6. Build settings optimized for React Router v7
7. Deployment successful with application accessible via Vercel URL
8. Vercel Analytics and Web Vitals enabled for monitoring

## Story 1.4: Implement User Authentication with Clerk

As a Product Manager,
I want to log in securely using Clerk authentication,
so that I can access the validation tool with enterprise-grade security.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Clerk authentication integrated with sign-up and sign-in components
2. Email/password and OAuth providers configured (Google, GitHub)
3. User profile synced between Clerk and PostgreSQL database
4. Protected routes using Clerk's middleware redirect to login when not authenticated
5. User session management handled by Clerk
6. Logout functionality properly clears Clerk session
7. Error handling for authentication failures with user-friendly messages

## Story 1.5: Create Basic Application Shell with Navigation

As a Product Manager,
I want a basic application interface with navigation,
so that I can navigate between different sections of the tool.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Header with The Compass logo/title and user menu
2. Navigation menu with placeholder links for future features
3. Responsive layout working on desktop and tablet
4. User email displayed when logged in
5. Consistent styling using CSS modules or Tailwind
6. Loading states for navigation transitions
