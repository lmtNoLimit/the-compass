# Epic 2: Persona & AI Integration Setup

Integrate Vertex AI to create our first working persona with full interview capabilities. This epic establishes the core AI engine, enabling end-to-end validation of a feature idea through an intelligent persona interview, producing raw but valuable feedback.

## Story 2.1: Set Up Google Cloud Project and Vertex AI Access

As a developer,
I want Vertex AI properly configured and accessible,
so that we can build and deploy AI agents.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Google Cloud project created with billing account (free tier)
2. Vertex AI API enabled in the project
3. Service account created with appropriate IAM roles
4. Service account key securely stored in environment variables
5. Vertex AI Node.js SDK installed and configured
6. Test connection to Vertex AI successful
7. Documentation for GCP setup added to README

## Story 2.2: Create First Vertex AI Agent for Persona Simulation

As a developer,
I want a working AI agent that can act as a customer persona,
so that we can simulate user interviews.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Vertex AI Agent created using Agent Builder
2. System prompt defines "Enterprise Admin" persona with background, goals, pain points
3. Agent grounded with consistent behavior patterns
4. Temperature and other parameters tuned for consistent responses
5. Agent tested with sample questions producing coherent responses
6. Agent version control established for prompt iterations

## Story 2.3: Design and Implement Interview Question Flow

As a Product Manager,
I want a structured 8-10 question interview sequence,
so that validations explore all critical dimensions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Interview template with 8-10 progressive questions defined
2. Questions cover: initial reaction, value perception, concerns, alternatives, adoption barriers
3. Dynamic follow-up questions based on persona responses
4. Question flow stored in configurable format (JSON/YAML)
5. Ability to test individual questions in isolation
6. Documentation of question design rationale

## Story 2.4: Build AI Interview Orchestration Service

As a developer,
I want a service that manages the complete interview process,
so that Feature Briefs can be validated automatically.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Service accepts Feature Brief data as input
2. Formats Feature Brief into context for the AI agent
3. Executes questions sequentially, maintaining conversation context
4. Handles API errors with retry logic and fallbacks
5. Captures all Q&A pairs with timestamps
6. Returns structured interview transcript
7. Implements rate limiting to stay within quotas

## Story 2.5: Create Simple Test Interface for Persona Validation

As a Product Manager,
I want a basic interface to test persona responses,
so that we can validate AI quality before full implementation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Simple form to input feature description
2. "Run Interview" button triggers AI interview
3. Real-time display of questions being asked
4. Raw responses shown as interview progresses
5. Complete transcript displayed at end
6. Ability to save test results for review
7. Basic metrics: response time, token usage
