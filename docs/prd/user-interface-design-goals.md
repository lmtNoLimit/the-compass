# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Clean, focused, and confidence-inspiring interface that guides Product Managers through validation with minimal cognitive load. The design should feel like a trusted advisor—professional yet approachable, powerful yet simple. Every interaction should reinforce the value of structured thinking while making the process feel effortless.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Guided Input:** Smart defaults, inline examples, and contextual help at every step
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live validation, progress indicators, and immediate visual responses
- **Scannable Results:** Information hierarchy that surfaces key insights first, details on demand

## Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard/Home:** Recent validations list, quick stats, and prominent "New Validation" CTA
- **Feature Brief Input:** Multi-step form with progress indicator, field validation, and example drawer
- **Processing View:** Animated interview simulation showing questions being asked and answered
- **Validation Brief Results:** Structured report with executive summary, detailed sections, and export options
- **History/Search:** Filterable grid of past validations with quick preview and full view options
- **Persona Gallery:** Visual cards showing available personas with descriptions and use cases

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensuring all Product Managers can effectively use the tool regardless of abilities, with proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear focus indicators.

## Branding

Modern, professional aesthetic aligned with internal tools guidelines. Clean typography, subtle use of brand colors for CTAs and success states. Data visualization using accessible color palettes. No excessive animations—focus on clarity and speed.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop (1440px+) for detailed work, with responsive design supporting tablets (768px+) for review and reading. Mobile view deferred to post-MVP.
