7. Draft expiration after 30 days of inactivity

## Story 3.5: Create Feature Brief Submission and Validation Queue

As a Product Manager,
I want to submit completed Feature Briefs for validation,
so that they can be processed by the AI interview system.

2. Final confirmation modal with brief summary
