# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Reduce product validation cycle time by 90% (from 3-5 days to under 5 minutes)
- Enable Product Managers to test 5x more ideas per week (25+ vs current 5)
- Improve decision quality with consistent, unbiased AI-powered persona feedback
- Create shareable documentation trail for all validated ideas
- Establish foundation for future Product Intelligence Platform
- Achieve 80% PM adoption within 30 days of launch

## Background Context

Product teams face an unacceptable trade-off between speed and quality in early-stage feature validation. The current process requires 3-5 days for initial feedback through stakeholder meetings and informal discussions, yielding inconsistent and often biased results. This bottleneck causes Product Managers to spend 15-20% of their time in preliminary validation meetings while still allowing poorly vetted ideas to consume downstream design and engineering resources.

The Compass solves this by automating initial validation through AI-powered persona interviews. Using structured Feature Briefs as input, the system conducts depth interviews with predefined customer personas and generates comprehensive Validation Briefs within minutes. This "Accelerated Insight" approach enables teams to test more ideas, kill bad concepts early, and enter real user research with greater confidenceâ€”ultimately leading to more successful products and stronger competitive positioning.
