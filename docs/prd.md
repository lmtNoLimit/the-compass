# The Compass Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Reduce product validation cycle time by 90% (from 3-5 days to under 5 minutes)
- Enable Product Managers to test 5x more ideas per week (25+ vs current 5)
- Improve decision quality with consistent, unbiased AI-powered persona feedback
- Create shareable documentation trail for all validated ideas
- Establish foundation for future Product Intelligence Platform
- Achieve 80% PM adoption within 30 days of launch

### Background Context

Product teams face an unacceptable trade-off between speed and quality in early-stage feature validation. The current process requires 3-5 days for initial feedback through stakeholder meetings and informal discussions, yielding inconsistent and often biased results. This bottleneck causes Product Managers to spend 15-20% of their time in preliminary validation meetings while still allowing poorly vetted ideas to consume downstream design and engineering resources.

The Compass solves this by automating initial validation through AI-powered persona interviews. Using structured Feature Briefs as input, the system conducts depth interviews with predefined customer personas and generates comprehensive Validation Briefs within minutes. This "Accelerated Insight" approach enables teams to test more ideas, kill bad concepts early, and enter real user research with greater confidence—ultimately leading to more successful products and stronger competitive positioning.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Clean, focused, and confidence-inspiring interface that guides Product Managers through validation with minimal cognitive load. The design should feel like a trusted advisor—professional yet approachable, powerful yet simple. Every interaction should reinforce the value of structured thinking while making the process feel effortless.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Guided Input:** Smart defaults, inline examples, and contextual help at every step
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live validation, progress indicators, and immediate visual responses
- **Scannable Results:** Information hierarchy that surfaces key insights first, details on demand

### Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard/Home:** Recent validations list, quick stats, and prominent "New Validation" CTA
- **Feature Brief Input:** Multi-step form with progress indicator, field validation, and example drawer
- **Processing View:** Animated interview simulation showing questions being asked and answered
- **Validation Brief Results:** Structured report with executive summary, detailed sections, and export options
- **History/Search:** Filterable grid of past validations with quick preview and full view options
- **Persona Gallery:** Visual cards showing available personas with descriptions and use cases

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensuring all Product Managers can effectively use the tool regardless of abilities, with proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear focus indicators.

### Branding

Modern, professional aesthetic aligned with internal tools guidelines. Clean typography, subtle use of brand colors for CTAs and success states. Data visualization using accessible color palettes. No excessive animations—focus on clarity and speed.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop (1440px+) for detailed work, with responsive design supporting tablets (768px+) for review and reading. Mobile view deferred to post-MVP.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all code (frontend, backend, configurations) to simplify development, deployment, and code sharing during MVP phase.

### Service Architecture

**Modular Monolith** - Single deployable application with clear module boundaries:
- **Web Module:** Remix application serving UI and handling server-side rendering
- **API Module:** Express.js REST API for business logic and data operations
- **AI Module:** Vertex AI integration layer with agent orchestration and persona management
- **Data Module:** MongoDB data access layer with model definitions

This architecture allows future migration to microservices if needed while keeping MVP development simple.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** approach:
- Unit tests for business logic and utility functions (target: 70% coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints and Vertex AI agent interactions
- Playground environment for testing and refining persona behaviors
- Manual testing convenience methods for persona simulation validation
- End-to-end testing deferred to post-MVP

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Vertex AI** will power our agent and persona system, providing:
  - Agent Builder for creating sophisticated interview agents
  - Conversation design tools for structured interviews
  - Grounding capabilities to ensure consistent persona behaviors
  - Built-in evaluation metrics for response quality
- **Remix** will handle both SSR and client-side interactions using its built-in data loaders and actions
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety and better developer experience
- **MongoDB** schemas will be flexible initially but with TypeScript interfaces for structure
- **Vertex AI SDK** will be accessed through Google Cloud's Node.js client library
- **Authentication** will use simple email/password initially with migration path to SSO
- **File exports** (PDF/Markdown) will be generated server-side using Puppeteer or similar
- **Vercel deployment** will use React Router preset with automatic deploys and preview environments
- **Environment variables** will manage API keys and configuration across environments
- **Rate limiting** will be implemented at application level to manage Vertex AI quotas
- **Persona definitions** will be stored as Vertex AI agent configurations with version control
- **Prompt templates** will be managed through Vertex AI's prompt management features
